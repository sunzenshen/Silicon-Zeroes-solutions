Silicon Zeroes solutions
========================

Save files for the fantasy-anachronism SPECTRE/MELTDOWN CPU design bugs reinvention game [Silicon Zeroes](http://pleasingfungus.com/Silicon%20Zeroes/).

Solutions for the later levels provided by [Under-estimate](https://github.com/Under-estimate)

Spoiler warning since the file names imply the theme of the challenges.
But you might have already been exposed since GitHub puts the README preview after the file list. ^_^;

These are in the same format of the solution files that are produced by the game.
That means you can try these solutions out by copying into the \Steam\steamapps\common\Silicon Zeroes\profiles\profile0\saves directory.

If these save games are useful or interesting,
take comfort that I don't care to enforce some arbitrary copyright on some fun game-related code;
just don't inexplicably harm yourself with it. (Though that would be impressive, given the imaginary architecture!)

Feel free to reach out if there's any concern.
Most likely response is I don't mind; what nefarious business could you possibly perpetrate with fantasy VDHL circuit descriptions?
